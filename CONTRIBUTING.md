# Contributing Guidelines

**Style Standard: PEP8**
**Rules specified below take precedent over PEP8.**


- Import `ModuleType` for all modules.
- All modules should use class structure, even where it is not necessary.
- For versioned libraries such as cv2, import them as `lib`, without the version (ex. `import cv2 as cv`).
- Use single quotes for all strings, except in situations where you need to print a single quote.
- Use 1 line break before and after functions.
